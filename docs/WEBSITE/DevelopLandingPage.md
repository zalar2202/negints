### 11. FAQ (Development-Specific)

| Question                                    | Answer                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Do I own the code?**                      | 100%. Once paid for, the repository and IP are yours. We don't lock you in.                                                                                          |
| **What tech stack do you use?**             | We primarily use the modern JavaScript stack (React, Next.js, Node.js) because it offers the best balance of performance, scalability, and community support.        |
| **Do you provide hosting?**                 | We set up hosting for you on your preferred accounts (e.g., Vercel, AWS), so you have full control. We don't resell hosting, so you pay the provider directly.      |
| **What about maintenance?**                 | We offer maintenance packages to keep libraries updated, monitor security, and fix any bugs that appear post-launch.                                                 |
| **Can you take over an existing project?**  | Yes, but we'll need to do a code audit first to assess the quality of the current codebase and see if it's viable to build upon or needs refactoring.               |
| **Is the site mobile-friendly?**            | Absolutely. All our development is responsive by default, ensuring it looks perfect on phones, tablets, and desktops.                                                |
